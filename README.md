# A dice game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Roll the dice to increase your score, but be careful not to roll a 1! Otherwise you lose all your points and it becomes the next players turn. Hold function will hold your score and switch players. 

## First player to reach a score of 100 wins the game!
